# LLM Projects: Summarization and Q&A Applications

This repository demonstrates two powerful applications powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and LangChain:
- **Text Summarization:** Automatically generate concise summaries of web articles.
- **Question and Answer (Q&A):** Interactively query web content using a vector-based retrieval approach.

## Overview
This project is built to showcase the integration of LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for natural language processing tasks. The two main functionalities include:
- **Summarization:** Summarize content from a provided blog URL.
- **Q&A:** Answer questions based on the content from the provided URL using vector retrieval.

## Features
- **Web Data Extraction:** Load content from web pages using LangChain's `WebBaseLoader`.
- **Text Summarization:** Generate summaries with a GPT-3.5 model.
- **Vector-Based Q&A:** Leverage OpenAI embeddings and FAISS for intelligent retrieval and answering.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Streamlit apps for interactive usage.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Basic validation and error management for inputs and network calls.
- **Deployment Ready:** Options for local development and containerized deployment via Docker.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm_projects.git
   cd llm_projects
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Text Summarization App
Run the summarization Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
streamlit run streamlit_llm.py
In the app sidebar, enter:

The URL of the blog/article.

Your OpenAI API key.

Hit Enter and view the generated summary along with an embedded tutorial video.

Q&A App
Run the Q&A Streamlit app (if integrated in a separate file, adjust accordingly):

bash
Copy
streamlit run streamlit_llm.py
In the app sidebar, input:

The URL of the blog/article.

Your OpenAI API key.
